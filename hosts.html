            The Mexican Debate Association [Asociación Mexicana de Debate] (AMD) is a non-governmental organization that promotes debate in México. The objective of the AMD is to spread debate culture across the country and to promote spaces for the cultivation of  freedom of speech. AMD also seeks to form citizens that can become agents of change in their communities by generating solutions to problems through dialogue. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Made up by students, former students and debate coaches with experience at the most important debating competitions in the world, the AMD organizes and collaborates in the running of debate competitions through the year in Mexico.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Among the most important events organized by the AMD are the two university-level national championships (one in Spanish, the other in English), both of these are held in the British Parliamentary format. Furthermore, AMD organizes and coordinates a Metropolitan Debate League in Mexico City. The AMD also offers debate training in its constant effort to promote an activity that it firmly believes can aid in fostering a democratic culture and society in Mexico, as well as in empowering youths to take an active role in their communities, be they local, national or global.
