          <h1>WUDC</h1>
          <p> The  World  Universities  Debating Championship  (WUDC)  is  the  largest English-speaking  debate competition in the world.</p>
          <p> The  WUDC  has  been  held  annually since  1981.  Every  year  the  WUDC  takes  place  in  a  different country and is hosted by a different  university and by different debate societies. The tournament gathers  students  from  prestigious  universities  around  the  globe, featuring  over  400  teams  from around 90 countries. </p>
          <p> The tournament lasts a week filled with the best level of debate rounds in the world. The debates employ the British Parliamentary (BP) format in which four teams compete against each other  on two  opposite  positions  on  a  given  motion,  which  is  announced  fifteen  minutes  before  every debate.  The  competition is  run in  nine  rounds  under a Swiss-system  where  teams  of  a  similar level face  off  against  each  other,  until  the  best  forty-eight  break  to  the  direct elimination  rounds.  The best  English-as-a-Second-Language  (ESL)  and  English-as-a-Foreign-Language  (EFL)  teams  enter  their own elimination rounds.</p>
          <p> The  championship  also  features  a  Masters  competition, which  also  uses  the  BP  format.  The Masters competition is open to judges, members of the adjudication core and organizers. There is also  a  Public  Speaking  Competition  that  consists  of  participants  presenting  a  speech  on  a  given topic with just a few minutes beforehand to prepare it.</p>
          <p> "Worlds",  as  the  WUDC  is  commonly  known,  crowns  the  winners  with  the  title   of  World Champions.  The  event  also  prizes  the  winners  of  the  ESL,  EFL,  Masters  and  the  Public  Speaking Competition categories.</p>
          <p> Despite  the  international  nature  of  the  event  and  the  participation  of teams from  Spanish-speaking countries in the competition, this is the first time in the history of the event that such a   country will host the Championship. This testifies to the increasing internationalization and impact of the WUDC on the world, and will also serve to promote debate as an activity in Mexico. </p>
          <p>The Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education  Campus  Santa  Fe (ITESM CSF) will  be    the   host  of  the  38th  edition  of  the World Universities  Debating  Championship,    which  will  be organized by the  Mexican  Debate Association  (AMD)  with  the  support  of  the  ITESM CSF, and other sponsors from the private and public sectors. </p>
