                  <h2 class='modal-title'>David Alatorre L√≥pez</h2>
                  <p> David started competing in debate in high school, when he was selected to be part of Team M√©xico's World Schools Debating Championship (WSDC) team for Qatar 2010. When he realized that some of his competitors from around the world had been to dozens of competitions before and had college debate circuits, he decided he had a moral responsibility to help debate grow in his country. This meant that he became the first Mexican in many things ‚Äîalmost always alongside another Mexican: first Mexican to compete at a BP tournament (2010); to found a BP debate team; to reach a grand final abroad (2010) and in Europe, the United States, and South America; to compete at a world championship; to reach the grand final of the Spanish Worlds (Campeonato Mundial de Debate Universitiario en Espa√±ol [CMUDE]) in 2012; to receive a speaker award at both Spanish and English Worlds (2nd in CMUDE 2011 and 5th best EFL speaker at WUDC 2013); to be part of the adjudication core of an international tournament (DCA at CMUDE 2014); to convene and be CA of a tournament in Mexico; to be CA at an international tournament (Pan-Ams 2016), and to be an independent, subsidized adjudicator at WUDC 2016.
                     <br><br>David has an unbridled love for his country and has found in debate a way to help make it a better place and that is why he ‚Äîalong with people he calls friends‚Äî founded the Asociaci√≥n Mexicana de Debate A.C. [Mexican Debate Association], of which he is the first president and which has successfully bid to bring the 38th WUDC for the first time not only to Latin America and the Caribbean but to the entire Spanish-speaking world.

                  <p> Hi! My name is Samantha Mena, debate has been a passion of mine since I was little. The first time that it caught my eye was when I was in 9th grade. But it wasn‚Äôt until I was in high school  that it stopped being just a simple hobby and turned to be a big part of my world. I was part of the Churchill College Debate team and participated in every single tournament that the Circuit organized almost monthly. I had my peak during 2013, when I was selected as one of the team members that would be representing Mexico in the Panamerican Schools‚Äô Debating Championship. That adventure went on for another year, when once again in 2014 I was chosen to be a part of this team once more. </p>
                  <p> For reasons I still don‚Äôt fully understand, when I had to choose a BA I went for Graphic Design. Regardless of this my debate career wasn‚Äôt over as I was Co-coach of the Prepa IBERO debate team until 2016. After that I wanted to expand the Debate culture all through the University and so I went on and founded the debating society at a university level at IBERO, and I am currently president of that same society. </p>
                  <p> When I heard that WUDC was taking place in Mexico City, I wanted to be part of it any way I could. That is how I got the opportunity of mixing both of my biggest passions and joining the design team. Giving back a little bit to the community that gave me so much. You can see more of my design work <a href="https://www.behance.net/sammc958eae"> here.</a></p>

She is a founding member of the Debate Club at the Faculty of Engineering, UNAM with other friends from school (yes, engineers like and can debate too!). She was thrilled with the idea of WUDC happening in Mexico, so she decided to be part of the Org Comm, because ‚Äúpeople (especially our generation) should be able to be involved in more debating activities, due to all the skills ( mental and emotional) it helps you develop", at least in her experience. She‚Äôs also a people person, which helps explain why she‚Äôs part of the incredible volunteers team. </p>
